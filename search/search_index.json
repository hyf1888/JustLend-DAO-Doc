The Borrow Limit, set by JustLend DAO Governance for each asset, determines the maximum percentage of value that can be borrowed against the asset. For example, if a user supplies $100 in TRX with an collateral factor 80% and $200 in SUN with an collateral factor 75%. Then, borrows $90 worth of USDD and $50 worth of JST tokens from SBM. we can see:</p> <p>Borrow Limit  =  \u2211 (Asset supplied * Collateral Factor) = 100 * 80% + 200 * 75% = 230</p> <p>Risk Value  =  Total Borrow / Borrow Limit * 100 = (90 + 50) / 230 * 100 = 60.87</p> <p>A risk value above 100 represents a position that is above the liquidation threshold. Regular monitoring is essential, as the risk value fluctuates based on both the value of collateral factor and borrowed assets. To reduce the risk value , users can either supply more collateral or repay part of the borrow position. The risk value is directly tied to collateral value. If the collateral value increases, the risk value  decrease; if it falls, the risk value increases, increasing the risk of liquidation.</p> Range Levels of risk Recommendations 0-35 Low Risk Healthy portfolio, eligible for loans. 35-60 Medium Risk Healthy portfolio overall, eligible for extra loan, but with caution. 60-80 High Risk High Risk Portfolio faces risk of liquidation, and you are advised to add collateral or pay off part of your loans. 80-100 Extremely High Risk Collaterals are about to be liquidated, and you are advised to add collateral or pay off part of your loans. <p>Liquidation occurs when a borrower\u2019s risk value exceeds 100, indicating that their collateral is insufficient to cover the borrowed amount. This can happen due to a decline in collateral value or an increase in the borrowing amount. During a liquidation, a liquidator can repay up to 50% of a borrower's debt for a single asset in one liquidation transaction, and a liquidation fee is applied to the borrower\u2019s collateral.
