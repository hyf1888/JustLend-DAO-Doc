Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol.   - Interest Rate Model: users with a positive balance of the base asset earn interest, denominated in the base asset, based on a supply rate model.   - Price-Oracle: contains the price oracle contracts we support, along with the logic validation for prices returned by these oracles.   - Governance: contracts used for proposing, voting and executing proposals.   - Comptroller: the risk management layer of the protocol. It determines how much collateral a user is required to maintain, and whether user can be liquidated. - Staked TRX: the contracts utilized for staking TRX to earn high rewards. - Energy Rental: contracts enable users to rent energy anytime with a low price.</p>"},{"location":"developers/contracts_overview/#core-contracts","title":"Core Contracts","text":"<p>There are 5 categories of core repository contracts: - JTokens Contract - Interest Rate Model Contract - Price Oracle Contract - Governance Contract - Comptroller Contract</p>"},{"location":"developers/contracts_overview/#jtokens-contract","title":"JTokens Contract","text":"<p><code>JToken:</code> the contract used to support all assets by JustLend DAO, such as the jTRX, jUSDT, jSUN and jBTC you receive after supplying the corresponding assets.</p>"},{"location":"developers/contracts_overview/#interest-rate-model-contract","title":"Interest Rate Model Contract","text":"<p><code>WhitePaperInterestRateModel:</code> the contract used to set up a straightforward interest rate model, which the borrowing rate is directly proportional to the utilization.</p> <p><code>JumpRateModelV2:</code> the Contract used to set up a complex interest rate model, which the interest rate jumps to a higher tier when the utilization rate exceeds u optimal.</p>"},{"location":"developers/contracts_overview/#price-oracle-contract","title":"Price Oracle Contract","text":"<p><code>Price Oracle:</code> the JustLend Protocol use WinkLink's price service to fetch the token price.

JustLend DAO fosters consensus among all participants in the JustLend ecosystem through governance mechanisms and economic incentives. The protocol's functions and the JST token serve as core security elements of the JustLend protocol.</p> <p>Governance mechanisms in decentralized protocols are driven by participation, incentives, self-regulation, and policy management within the community, adapting to and coexisting with the market dynamics. JustLend DAO manages on-chain operations through proposals, enabling the protocol to achieve self-operation, self-governance, and self-evolution based on predefined rules through intelligent management and token economic incentives, without third-party intervention, ultimately maximizing efficiency and value transfer.</p> <p>An essential incentive method in the governance process of JustLend DAO, JST tokenizes various organizational elements, integrating monetary capital, human capital, and other resources to enhance organizational efficiency significantly. The goal of the JST economy is to facilitate the virtuous and long-term development of the entire JustLend DAO ecosystem, allowing stakeholders and investors to benefit from a more secure agreement. JST holders are accountable for the protocol and ecosystem, contributing through practical actions such as technical integration (e.g., DeFi front-end integration) or financial investments (e.g., liquidity provision), significantly enhancing protocol execution, security, and functionality.</p> <p>The JustLend DAO was established to facilitate the development and long-term governance of the JustLend DAO protocol. The goal is to create a future-proof governance framework leveraging system incentives and multi-level governance to maintain an effective balance that drives long-term growth and continuous protocol optimization.</p>"},{"location":"governance/jips/#governance-process","title":"Governance Process","text":"<p>JustLend Protocol's governance relies on participants locking JST tokens to acquire voting power for JustLend Improvement Proposals (JIPs).  The governance is first discussed in the JustLend DAO forum. If there is no contentious, then it is conducted through voting. Any users who hold more than 200 million JST can initiate a proposal on the platform, and other users can participate in the vote. If and only if the number of votes in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of negative votes and meanwhile exceeds 600 million, the proposal can be passed and implemented two days later.</p> <p>JST tokens enable holders to collectively act as managers of the protocol, enabling them to vote and propose. The process of submitting a proposal and voting is as shown below (before entering the lock phase, you can cancel the created proposal at any time by proposal)</p> <ol> <li>JST holders call governance contracts to create proposals. Once a proposal is successfully created, it will undergo a 2-day review period. Voting rights are then recorded, and the voting process begins after the review period ends.</li> <li>JST holders receive votes and can choose to either support or oppose a proposal based on its content. Each JST holder is entitled to one vote. The voting period lasts for 3 days.</li> <li>Once the voting period ends, the governance contract will determine whether the proposal has been approved based on the number of votes. If the proposal does not pass, it will be terminated. If the proposal is approved, it will trigger the time lock executor.</li> <li>If the proposal is passed, the proposal will enter a lock-up period of 48 hours. After the lock-up period ends, the proposal will be in a pending state, and the proposal will take effect immediately after the execution.</li> </ol> <p>Taken together, in general, a full proposal will take at least a week.</p>"},{"location":"resources/community/","title":"Links","text":""},{"location":"resources/community/#websites","title":"Websites","text":"<ul> <li>Main JUST Network</li> <li>Main JustLend Network</li> <li>JustLend Markets</li> <li>JUST Stablecoin (USDJ)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/community/#telegram-groups","title":"Telegram groups","text":"<ul> <li>JUST-Defi</li> <li>JustLend DAO Official</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/community/#forum","title":"Forum","text":"<ul> <li>JustLend DAO Forum</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/community/#x-formerly-twitter","title":"X (Formerly Twitter)","text":"<ul> <li>JUST-Defi Twitter</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/community/#developers","title":"Developers","text":"<ul> <li>Github</li> <li>Bug Bounty</li> </ul>"}]}
