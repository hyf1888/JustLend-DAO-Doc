The JustLend DAO V2 adopts an Isolated Margin mechanism with a dual-layer structure of Vaults and Markets, and introduces the AdaptiveCurve Interest Rate Model (IRM). This new design aims to provide higher capital efficiency for depositors and borrowers while ensuring a robust risk isolation framework.
