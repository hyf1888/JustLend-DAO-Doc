# SBM V2

JustLend DAO V2 is a fully upgraded decentralized lending protocol built on the TRON network. It introduces a dual-layer isolated-lending model composed of Vaults and Markets, along with an Adaptive Curve Interest Rate Model (IRM) for dynamic rate adjustment. The V2 system primarily consists of several core smart contracts — **Moolah Market**, **Moolah Vault**, **TRX Provider**, **Resilient Oracle**, and **Interest Rate Model** — each serving a distinct purpose within the ecosystem:

* **Moolah Market** handles core lending and borrowing operations, including supply, withdrawal, collateral management, and liquidation. **MoolahMarket.sol** allows users to:
    * Market Creation
    * Supply
    * Withdraw
    * Borrow
    * Repay
    * Supply Collateral
    * Withdraw Collateral
    * Liquidation
* **Moolah Vault** manages pooled user assets, allocates funds to lending markets, and issues transferable shares following the ERC-4626 standard. **MoolahVault.sol** allows users to:
    * Vault Creation
    * Deposit
    * Mint
    * Withdraw
* **TRX Provider** enables seamless interaction between native TRX and wrapped TRX (WTRX), allowing users to supply or borrow using TRX directly. **TRXProvider.sol** allows users to:
    * Deposit
    * Mint
    * Withdraw
    * Redeem
    * Borrow
    * Repay
    * Supply Collateral
    * Withdraw Collateral
* **Resilient Oracle** aggregates multiple price feeds (up to three per token) to ensure reliable and accurate price data for the protocol. 
* **Interest Rate Model (IRM)** dynamically adjusts borrowing and supply rates in real time to maintain market utilization near the optimal level. 

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/justlend/justlend-protocol/blob/main/contracts/CToken.sol).

## **Configuration**

### **1. Position**
In each market, every user has a corresponding Position, which records the user’s supplied, borrowed, and collateralized assets within that market.
``` solidity
struct Position {
  uint256 supplyShares;
  uint128 borrowShares;
  uint128 collateral;
}
```
* `supplyShares:` the number of shares representing the assets a user has supplied to the market.
* `borrowShares:` the number of shares representing the assets a user has borrowed from the market.
* `collateral:` the amount of assets a user has deposited as collateral in the market.


### **2. Market**
``` solidity
struct Market {
  uint128 totalSupplyAssets;
  uint128 totalSupplyShares;
  uint128 totalBorrowAssets;
  uint128 totalBorrowShares;
  uint128 lastUpdate;
  uint128 fee;
}
```
* `totalSupplyAssets:` the total amount of assets supplied to the market and available for lending.
* `totalSupplyShares:` the total number of supply shares in the market.
* `totalBorrowAssets:` the total amount of assets borrowed from the market.
* `totalBorrowShares:` the total number of borrowed shares in the market.
* `lastUpdate:` the timestamp of the last market state update.
* `fee:` the fee rate charged by the market.

**Relationship between assets and shares:** At the beginning, one token corresponds to one share. Over time, as the market generates interest income, the total amount of tokens increases while the total number of shares remains constant. Consequently, each share becomes redeemable for more tokens, allowing users to earn yield when they withdraw their funds.


### **3. MarketParams**
``` solidity
struct MarketParams {
  address loanToken;
  address collateralToken;
  address oracle;
  address irm;
  uint256 lltv;
}
```
* `loanToken:` the address of the token used for borrowing.
* `collateralToken:` the address of the token used as collateral.
* `oracle:` the address of the price oracle contract.
* `irm:` the address of the interest rate model contract.
* `lltv:` the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) that determines the maximum borrowing limit based on the collateral value.


### **4. MarketConfig**
Represents the configuration of each market within the vault.
``` solidity
struct MarketConfig {
  uint176 cap;
  bool enabled;
  MarketType marketType;
  uint64 removableAt;
}
```
* `cap:` the maximum amount of assets that the vault can supply to this market.
* `enabled:` indicates whether the market is active; serves as a switch to control whether investments can be made to the market.
* `marketType:` the type of the market. This is used for compatibility with other lending protocols. Currently, only the Moolah market type is supported.
* `removableAt:` a timestamp indicating when the market can be immediately removed from the withdrawal queue.


### **5. MarketAllocation**
Used when reallocating asset investments across different markets.
``` solidity
struct MarketAllocation {
  MarketParams marketParams;
  uint256 assets;
}
```
* `marketParams:` specifies the target market to which the allocation is applied.
* `assets:` the amount of assets allocated to the specified market.


### **6. Authorization**
The Authorization struct represents the data required to grant or revoke authorization for a specific address.
``` solidity
struct Authorization {
    address authorizer;   
    address authorized;   
    bool isAuthorized;   
    uint256 nonce;        
    uint256 deadline;    
}
```
* `authorizer:` the address that is granting authorization or revocation.
* `authorized:` the address that is being granted or revoked the authorization.
* `isAuthorized:` a boolean indicating whether the authorization is being granted (true) or revoked (false).
* `nonce:` a unique number to prevent replay attacks. This value must be incremented each time a new authorization is signed.
* `deadline:` a timestamp indicating when the authorization will expire. If the current block timestamp exceeds this value, the authorization is no longer valid.


### **7. Signature**
The Signature struct represents the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signature used to verify that a particular authorization was signed by the authorizer.
``` solidity
struct Signature {
    uint8 v;    
    bytes32 r;    
    bytes32 s;   
}
```
* `v:` the recovery id (0 or 1) used to recover the public key from the signature. It indicates which of the two possible curve points was used for signing.
* `r:` the "r" component of the ECDSA signature, which is derived from the elliptic curve.
* `s:` the "s" component of the ECDSA signature, which is another part of the signature that helps uniquely identify it.

### **Moolah Valut**
A Vault is a single-asset management contract that provides borrowable assets to the market and can be created by anyone. Each vault operates as an independent contract managed by a designated fund manager, who can configure which markets to supply liquidity to. When users deposit assets into the vault, the funds are automatically allocated to the configured markets. The fund manager also has the ability to reallocate funds across markets. The vault follows the ERC-4626 standard (an extension of ERC-20 for tokenized vaults), allowing users to mint transferable shares upon depositing assets.

### **TRX Provider**
Since both the Moolah Market and MoolahVault operate with TRC20 tokens, WTRX is used as a wrapped version of TRX. Users can interact directly with TRX through the TRXProvider, which internally handles the conversion between TRX and WTRX before executing the corresponding operations in the market or vault.


#### **1. Deposit**
When users stake TRX, the TRXProvider automatically converts TRX into WTRX and deposits it into the corresponding Vault.
``` solidity
// Deposit without specifying a vault
function deposit(address receiver) external payable returns (uint256 shares)

// Deposit with a specified vault
function deposit(address vault, address receiver) public payable returns (uint256 shares)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `valut:` the address of the specific Vault where the converted WTRX will be deposited. If not specified, the system automatically deposits into the default Vault configured by the TRXProvider.
    * `receiver:` the address that will receive the minted vault shares corresponding to the deposited assets.
* **Returns:**
    * `shares:` the number of vault shares minted for the receiver based on the amount of TRX (converted to WTRX) deposited into the specified vault.


#### **2. Mint**
This function stakes TRX similar to the deposit function, but instead of specifying the asset amount, users specify the number of shares they wish to mint. The TRXProvider converts the provided TRX into WTRX and deposits it into the vault.
``` solidity
// Mint without specifying a vault
function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) external payable returns (uint256 assets)

// Mint with a specified vault
function mint(address vault, uint256 shares, address receiver) public payable returns (uint256 assets)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `valut:` the address of the specific Vault where the converted WTRX will be deposited. If not specified, the system automatically deposits into the default Vault configured by the TRXProvider.
    * `shares:` the number of vault shares to mint.
    * `receiver:` the address that will receive the minted vault shares corresponding to the deposited assets.
* **Returns:**
    * `assets:` the amount of TRX (converted to WTRX) required to mint the specified number of shares.


#### **3. Withdraw**
Withdraws TRX. The TRXProvider retrieves the corresponding amount of WTRX from the vault, converts it back to TRX, and transfers it to the user.
``` solidity
// Withdraw without specifying a vault
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address payable receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 shares)

// Withdraw with a specified vault
function withdraw(address vault, uint256 assets, address payable receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 shares)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `valut:` the address of the specific Vault where the converted WTRX will be deposited. If not specified, the system automatically deposits into the default Vault configured by the TRXProvider.
    * `assets:` the amount of TRX to withdraw (converted from WTRX).
    * `receiver:` the address that will receive the withdrawn TRX.
    * `owner:` the address that owns the withdrawn assets (payer of the shares).
* **Returns:**
    * `shares:` the number of shares burned in exchange for the specified amount of TRX.


#### **4. Redeem**
Withdraws TRX. Similar to withdrawal, but instead of specifying the withdrawal amount, the user specifies the number of shares to redeem. The TRXProvider retrieves the corresponding amount of WTRX from the vault, converts it back to TRX, and transfers it to the user.
``` solidity
// Redeem without specifying a vault
function redeem(uint256 shares, address payable receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 assets)

// Redeem with a specified vault
function redeem(address vault, uint256 shares, address payable receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 assets)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `valut:` the address of the vault from which WTRX will be redeemed. If not specified, the default vault is used.
    * `shares:` the number of shares to redeem.
    * `receiver:` the address that will receive the redeemed TRX.
    * `owner:` the address that owns the redeemed shares.
* **Returns:**
    * `assets:` the amount of TRX received from redeeming the specified shares.


#### **5. Borrow**
Borrows TRX from the specified market. The TRXProvider interacts with the underlying vault and market contracts to withdraw the corresponding WTRX, converts it to TRX, and sends it to the user.
``` solidity
function borrow(MarketParams calldata marketParams, uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address onBehalf, address payable receiver) external returns (uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `marketParams:` the parameters identifying the market (including borrowable asset, collateral asset, oracle, interest rate model, and liquidation factor).
    * `assets:` the amount of TRX to borrow.
    * `shares:` the corresponding share amount representing the borrowed position.
    * `onBehalf:` the address on whose behalf the borrowing is executed.
    * `receiver:` the address that will receive the borrowed TRX.
* **Returns:**
    * `_assets:` the actual amount of TRX borrowed.
    * `_shares:` the number of shares corresponding to the borrowed assets.


#### **6. Repay**
Repays borrowed TRX. When a user repays, the TRXProvider converts the sent TRX into WTRX internally and uses it to repay the corresponding market debt.
``` solidity
function repay(MarketParams calldata marketParams, uint256 assets, uint256 shares, address onBehalf, bytes calldata data) external payable returns (uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `marketParams:` the parameters identifying the market (including borrowable asset, collateral asset, oracle, interest rate model, and liquidation factor).
    * `assets:` the amount of TRX to repay.
    * `shares:` the share amount corresponding to the repaid assets.
    * `onBehalf:` the address on whose behalf the repayment is made.
    * `data:` additional data that can be used for callback or custom logic.
* **Returns:**
    * `_assets:` the actual amount of TRX repaid.
    * `_shares:` the number of shares corresponding to the repaid amount.


#### **7. Supply Collateral**
Supplies TRX as collateral. When a user provides collateral in TRX, the TRXProvider automatically wraps TRX into WTRX and deposits it into the corresponding market as collateral.
``` solidity
function supplyCollateral(MarketParams calldata marketParams, address onBehalf, bytes calldata data) external payable
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `marketParams:` the parameters identifying the market (including borrowable asset, collateral asset, oracle, interest rate model, and liquidation factor).
    * `onBehalf:` the address on whose behalf the collateral is supplied.
    * `data:` additional data that can be used for callback or custom logic.
* **Returns:** None, reverts on error.


#### **8. Withdraw Collateral**
Withdraws TRX collateral. When a user withdraws collateral, the TRXProvider retrieves WTRX from the market, unwraps it into TRX, and transfers it to the specified receiver.
``` solidity
function withdrawCollateral(MarketParams calldata marketParams, uint256 assets, address onBehalf, address payable receiver)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `marketParams:` the parameters identifying the market (including borrowable asset, collateral asset, oracle, interest rate model, and liquidation factor).
    * `assets:` the amount of collateral (in TRX) to withdraw.
    * `onBehalf:` the address from which the collateral is withdrawn.
    * `receiver:` the address that receives the withdrawn TRX.
* **Returns:** None, reverts on error.

### **Resilient Oracle**
The Resilient Oracle is an aggregated price feed contract that supports configuring up to three price sources (in Chainlink API format) for each token. It allows querying the price of any token, with a precision of 18 decimals.


#### **1. Peek**
Retrieves the price of a specified token.
``` solidity
function peek(address asset) external view override returns (uint256)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `asset:` the token address to query.
* **Returns:** the current price of the token (with 18-decimal precision).

### **Interest Rate Model**
JustLend DAO V2 adopts the AdaptiveCurve Interest Rate Model, an enhanced version of the Jump Curve model from JustLend DAO V1. This upgraded model introduces dynamic adjustments, enabling interest rates to automatically adapt in real time to maintain market utilization around the optimal target level.


#### **1. Default TargetUtilization**
This value defines the optimal utilization level that the interest rate model aims to maintain. Under normal circumstances, it remains constant and only changes when the underlying interest rate model implementation is replaced.
``` solidity
function defaultTargetUtilization() external view returns (int256)
```
* **Parameter description:** N/A.
* **Returns:** the default target utilization rate of the market.


#### **2. Target Utilization**
If the market has a non-zero target utilization rate configured, that value is returned. Otherwise, the function returns the default target utilization rate.
``` solidity
function targetUtilization(Id id) public view returns (int256)
```
* **Parameter description:**
    * `id:` the unique identifier of the market.   
* **Returns:** the target utilization rate for a specific market.
